<PRE>Hi!

&gt;<i> you should really have a look at ODE. it saves us a great deal of work.
</I>&gt;<i> after seeing what a physics engine can do for us, I am no longer
</I>&gt;<i> demotivated by the video of the japanese racing game that art has shown
</I>&gt;<i> us yesterday. instead, now I say &quot;bah! he cheated! he used a physics
</I>&gt;<i> engine!&quot;
</I>That's right. As I already said, do no reinvent the wheel again. THis japanese 
guy has used Newton Physics Engine. This is something like ODE but can only 
be used on Windows.

&gt;<i> ODE still leaves a lot of work to do for the physics people. now that we
</I>&gt;<i> can think of our physical world in terms of bodies, joints, collision
</I>&gt;<i> spaces, collision geometry, etc. the question is what the structure of
</I>&gt;<i> the physical world in our game should look like.
</I>&gt;<i> for example: how do we build the physical representation of a car?
</I>&gt;<i> obviously this can not be done in 3DS. of course it can be hardcoded in
</I>&gt;<i> C++ code, but we do not want to do that.
</I>It will be better if you write your own format where you store your 3D-Data 
and physic properties. 

&gt;<i> let's say we have a 3DS file of a car. it will probably contain multiple
</I>&gt;<i> separate objects, like weels, etc. these objects probably have names by
</I>&gt;<i> which they can be referred. now we somehow have to associate each object
</I>&gt;<i> with a scene graph node and a physics body. we also need to connect the
</I>&gt;<i> bodies with joints and set the anchor points and axes of the joints. how
</I>&gt;<i> do we do that? we could specify the coordinates by hand, say in an XML
</I>&gt;<i> file, but that's ugly (you will agree to me once you have explained to
</I>&gt;<i> the design people that they will have to calculate and type in
</I>&gt;<i> coordinates by hand). it would be much nicer if (this is just an idea,
</I>&gt;<i> if you have a better one, you are welcome), the designer could place
</I>&gt;<i> some kind of &quot;dummy polygon&quot; in the 3DS scene, which marks the anchor. I
</I>&gt;<i> don't know how exactly this can be done, but I know that for example in
</I>&gt;<i> Unreal Tournament this technique was used to mark the points where
</I>&gt;<i> weapons are attached to player models.
</I>As I know there is an 3DS-Max Studio plugin where you can do things like this. 
Other possibility is to create dummy objects with unique names. Your object 
loader code can than remove this dummy object and replace it by joints, 
anchor or something else.

bye Art

P.S. As you all already know all of you should be now registered on the 
nrengine-stunts Mailinglist. So you do not have to write the email to all 
people just to the mailinglist.
