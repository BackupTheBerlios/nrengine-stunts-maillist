Hallo, People!

Because there was a lot of problems by registering on the stunts mailinglist 
and because some of you still do not understand that this is usefull, I 
decided to force your registration by hand.

So all of the stunts group are automaticly registered on the Stunts - 
Mailinglist. 

If someone did want to unsuscribe, so send me an eMail

bye bye,
 Art

Hallo alle,

It might be useful to have each other's phone number.

Mines are:

Mobile: 01762/0526858
Home: 06897/914348

Gruss.

Hi!

That's right. As I already said, do no reinvent the wheel again. THis japanese 
guy has used Newton Physics Engine. This is something like ODE but can only 
be used on Windows.

It will be better if you write your own format where you store your 3D-Data 
and physic properties.

As I know there is an 3DS-Max Studio plugin where you can do things like this. 
Other possibility is to create dummy objects with unique names. Your object 
loader code can than remove this dummy object and replace it by joints, 
anchor or something else.

bye Art

P.S. As you all already know all of you should be now registered on the 
nrengine-stunts Mailinglist. So you do not have to write the email to all 
people just to the mailinglist.

Ah, that would explain why I'm suddenly subscribed. :) Thanks.

Is it possible for an admin to set the reply-to address in e-mails
delivered by the mailinglist directly back to the mailing list by
default? Maybe that's just me, but I think that would make sense than
individual answers most of the time and be more convenient this way.

See you,

I agree, we should make a list of online contacts and phone numbers
for emergencies.

Mine for the record:

ICQ: 50846868
AIM/Yahoo: eLowar
MSN: msn at eLowar.com

Home phone: (06824) 709-284  (good luck getting me though...)
No mobile phone :)

Maybe somebody (I can if you want me to) should compile a list and put
it somewhere online (non-public of course), instead of just everybody
writing everybody's down. In any case, I suggest you just send your
contacts to the mailing list. :)

Pax Vobiscum,
-- Markus
